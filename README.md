### About

---

Let's agree, anyone could've made it within 10 mins (or 5 mins for pros) with basic HTML / CSS but i had plenty of time to spare so i thought "why not perfect it ?".

The project was sturcted taking scalability in mind. So components are structed very well.

**Still there is plenty of room for improvements so feel free to criticize.**
